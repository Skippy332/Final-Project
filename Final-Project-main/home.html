            <h1>Faith Baptist Church</h1>
            <p>500 W Lee Rd, Taylors SC 29687</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1 class="WTE">What to Expect</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>We Don’t Have It All Together: That’s probably why we’re such a close family. We’re all “limping through life” and growing in grace together.</li>
                <li>We’re Not Evaluating You. When you walk in, we’re just glad to see you! There’s no pressure to “measure up” or “fit in.” None of us really measure up, and we’re all unique. The tie that binds us together is not our sameness but our same God who sanctifies us.</li>
                <li>We’re Not About Religion. This might sound strange coming from a church, but religion often lets people down. Religious systems can feel confusing, complicated, and disconnected from real life. At Faith Baptist Church, we want to help you move beyond “religion” into a genuine relationship with Jesus Christ.</li>
                <li>We Speak Plainly. At Faith Baptist Church, we worship Jesus, study the Bible, and encourage each other in clear, understandable ways that connect to everyday struggles.</li>
                <li>We Teach the Bible and Its Relevance. No pointless traditions, no archaic language, and no irrelevant lectures. Instead, we open the Bible and apply its timeless truths to real life in the 21st century.</li>
                <li>We’re Just Regular, Friendly People. We’re not perfect or artificial. We’re regular people—working hard, trying to make ends meet, fighting for healthy relationships, and looking for encouragement. Together, we’re seeking God’s grace and finding hope in Jesus Christ.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2 class="WTE">What Will Sunday Morning Look Like? (Sundays at 9:30am)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>A Friendly, Grace-Filled Culture. Guests often tell us, “Wow, I’ve never been to a church like this!”</li>
                <li>Helpful Guidance. Greeters will warmly welcome you and help you find classes, nurseries, or even a cup of coffee to start your morning.</li>
                <li>A Place for Everyone. Whether it’s nurseries, children’s ministries, student ministries, or adult groups, there’s something designed for you and your family.</li>
                <li>Meaningful Worship. At Faith Baptist Church, we worship Jesus through music that’s both heartfelt and uplifting. Our goal is worship, not entertainment.</li>
                <li>A Practical Bible Message. Each Sunday, our pastor preaches a message that applies God’s wisdom to everyday situations. The Bible offers the answers you’ve been searching for.</li>
                <li>A Lasting Impact. Whatever you’re facing, we want to love and encourage you. God’s Word, grace, and love through Jesus Christ can make a massive difference in your life.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2 class="WTE">What Will Sunday Evening Look Like? (Sundays at 6:00pm)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Theological Discussions for Growing Disciples. Sunday evening services are designed to deepen your understanding of who God is and how His truth applies to your life. Our pastor’s message will intentionally focus on foundational doctrines, particularly our beliefs about the Godhead, to help us collectively grow in our faith.</li>
                <li>Youth and Children’s Choirs. Sunday evenings often feature special music from our teens and children’s choirs, showcasing the next generation as they sing praises to the Lord. These moments are encouraging and uplifting for the entire church family.</li>
                <li>Worship and Fellowship. In addition to focused teaching, Sunday evenings are a time to orient our hearts together as a church around the shared truths of God’s Word and His character.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2 class="WTE">What Will Wednesday Nights Look Like? (Wednesdays at 7:00pm)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Inductive Bible Study for Adults. Adults gather in the auditorium for an inductive Bible study format. This intentional approach equips you to read and understand God’s Word on your own, deepening your personal study and walk with Christ.</li>
                <li>Teen Program in the Youth Chapel. Our teens meet in the Youth Chapel, where they are taught relevant and practical truths from God’s Word that help them navigate life with purpose and faith.</li>
                <li>Kids4Truth for Children. Kids4Truth is an engaging program designed to teach children systematic theology in a fun and memorable way. This program partners with parents to instill biblical truths in their children’s hearts and minds.</li>
