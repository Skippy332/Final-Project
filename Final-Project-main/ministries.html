        Freedom that Lasts is the best place to be on a Friday night! We are a Christ-centered, Bible-based, local-church-focused discipleship ministry to those enslaved in life-dominating sins, overcome by hurtful events of life, or anyone wanting to grow in their relationship with Jesus Christ and away from any addictive choices.

We meet each Friday night from 7 to 9:15 PM at Faith Baptist Church, 500 West Lee Road, Taylors. We focus on knowing God, a new identity in Christ, and building healthy relationships as we grow essential virtues for stability and victory over enslaving sin for the Christian life found only in God’s Word. We want to “stand fast in the liberty” that we can have in Christ. Each weekly program includes a time of inspiring testimonies, encouraging small groups, and

Biblically based messages aimed at applying God’s principles in daily life. We end the evening with a time of enjoying good food, fellowshipping together, and forging friendships.
